# Election Analysis


## Project Overview

We are assisting an employee from the Colorado Board of Election with an analysis of election results
using Python. We will be using our election report list to calculate the following.

1.	Calculate the total number of votes casts.
2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3.	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
4.	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
5.	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote
